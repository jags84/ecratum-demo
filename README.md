# Chat Demo App

## Background:
The task is to create a simple web application that works as an Instant messaging application.

But there is a twist - all the instant messages should be translated via an API to one of three possible dialects (Yoda, Valley Girl and Binary Code) to make the instant messaging conversation more colorful :)

## Requirements:
```
Ruby 2.4.0
Rails 5.0.2
Redis Server
```

## Bundle:
```
  bundle install
```

## DB
```
  rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## RUN
```
  rails s
```

## RSPEC
```
  rspec
```
